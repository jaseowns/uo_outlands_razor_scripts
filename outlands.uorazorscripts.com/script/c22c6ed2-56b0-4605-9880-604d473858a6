# Simple and Improved Ban Bot by Jaseowns
# UO Outlands
# Requirements:
#   You need to setup a friends list called
#           "BanBot"
#   If you do not have that friends list setup
#   The script will error
#############
#   You can use >info on your sign to not have to select
#   it when you run the script (update line 25)
#   example: 
#   @setvar! homeSign 0x433A9C17
#############
#   If you have multiple homes, you can add position checks
#   and set the sign automagically based on the position
#   example on line 22
####
