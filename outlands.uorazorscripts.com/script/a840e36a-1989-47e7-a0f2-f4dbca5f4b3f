# Bapeths Reveal Spell + Auto Hide / Smokebomb Fuckery
#
# "In Warmode" :
# Play the script to Reveal + Auto hide / Smokebomb
# The faster you target the Reveal, the higher the chance your character will hide without smokebomb
# If you fail to hide, the script will attempt to use a smokebomb
# If your bombs are on cooldown and you fail to hide.. RUN
#
# "In Peacemode" :
# The script will act as a normal reveal spell

if warmode and skill "Magery" >= 60 and mana >= 20
