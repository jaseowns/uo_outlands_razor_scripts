# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
#  0. Click SAVE after pasting this script, then set the hotkey (Set HK) to a convenient key
#  1. Add Logs to Organizer Agent-11 (Agents => Organizer Agent-11 => Add => target logs in your pack)
#  2. Set your Organizer Agent-11 to a trapped pouch (Agents => Organizer Agent-11 => Clear Hot Bag => Select a trapped pouch)

# OTHER TIPS
#  3. To clean up your Journal, add these text filters (Filters => Add => type keywords (no quotes) ==> Check `Filter System Messages` Box => Okay
#       "cannot produce" (also check overhead box)
#       "harvestable resources"
#       "this item on?"
#       "You chop some"
#       "Organizer Agent queued"
#       "queued action"
#       "Organize Agent did not find"
#  4. Create a simple two-line Recall script and hotkey to be ready for Thieves/PKs
#       wait 50
#       [recallcharge Home (but change "Home" to the EXACT name of a rune in your runetome/runebook)

# EARLY HARVESTING TIPS
#  5. Stick with Mastercrafted Iron or Dull Copper hatchets.  No cost benefit above that, just convenience/looks
#  6. To reduce movement time, stand between as many trees as possible (script will harvest all trees within 2 blocks)
#  7. Other than script testing, don't harvest on Shelter Island, there is a 50% yield penalty and too much competition
#  8. Add all 10 Log colors to your Counter Bar so you can view your harvest yield without triggering your trapped pouch
#  9. While lumberjacking, if your trapped pouch triggers (you see/hear explosion), it's a THIEF, run or recall!
#  10. You can also add your spare/backup hatchets to Organizer Agent-11 to keep them protected as well
