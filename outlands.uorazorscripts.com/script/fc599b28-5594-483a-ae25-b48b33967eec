## Script: Bapeth's One-Tile Item Dumper
## Created by: barryroser#0
#############################################

# Bapeths One Tile Item Dump & Restock
#
# October 4th 2024 (added footwear logic/cutter for cloth storage)
#
# This script will quickly dump and sort all items you acquire while adventuring in Outlands.
# If you ever need to reset storage items, tomes, containers etc... simply delete the varibles in Script Options
#
# "PEACE MODE" : Will recall to your dump & restock spot and proceed to dump & restock.
#
# "WAR MODE" : Recall is blocked, the script assumes you are already in range of your containers and proceeds to dump & restock
#
# "***REQUIRED***"
#
# Items this script uses are as follows:
# 
# Do not put any of these items inside containers
# All of these items should be locked down/secured in your inn room or house
# Arrange these items so that you character can reach them from your house rune spot/inn room warp point (2 tile distance)
#   
# Two containers of any kind, locked down and secured in your house
# "A rare cloth tome"
# "A dyes tome"
# "An arcane rune tome"
# "A treasure map tome"
# "A ship upgrade tome"
# "A skill mastery tome"
# "A collectable card tome"
# "An ore map tome"
# "A skinning map tome"
# "A lumber map tome"
# "A fishing map tome"
# "A storeage shelf"
# "A bank deposit box"
# "A garden shelf"
# "A resource stockpile"
# "A magic item recycler"
# "A magic item vault"
# "A repair bench"
# "A rune tome" - with a rune marked to your dump & restock spot
#
# The script will assume your house rune is in the very first entry of the runebook
#
# Script starts here...
