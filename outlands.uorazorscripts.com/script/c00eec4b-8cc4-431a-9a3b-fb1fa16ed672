# Train Spirit Speak FAST by Chinga
#   Get to 80 in Shelter first (~10 mins), 80-120 takes ~5 hrs
#   Script resupplies, be near a stocked Shelf, or you need to carry:
#       ~7500 Ash to Magic Arrow yourself
#       ~750 Garlic, Ginseng, Root, Silk to Greater Heal
#       ~75 Mushroom & Delectable food for faster mana gain
#   *Use a Mastercrafted Avarhide Wizard Satchel to reduce reagent use
#   *Use Void armor for Auto Stats Restoration to speed things up
#   *Edit Shelf loadout to pull regs/food, I used 10% of the totals above
