## Script: Process COTW Fish

#############################################

// Fish checker and processor 0.1
// This script will attempt to submit the two types of saltwater fish you've specified are the current catch of the week candidates. 
// Then it will check the size of fish in your bag, keeping the largest ones for future COTW's and cutting the rest
// It needs scissors

// !!! Set the two saltwater COTW fish here (reference IDs at bottom)
