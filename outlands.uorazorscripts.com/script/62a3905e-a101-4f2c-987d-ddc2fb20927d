# Bapeth's Dungeon Rope + Tele
#
# This is a simple Rope + Tele script that calls Bapeths Modern Dungeon Picker script
#
# To use the Rope + Tele, bind this script to a hotkey and play,
# You must target the rope before the teleport casting time completes in order to preform the move
# If you do not target the rope in time the script will transform into a simple teleport spell
