 // Inceptors Arcane solution: 
// to further expound on the posibilties 
// of the capabilites of passthrough scripts 
// they can be extremly powerful to one with a 
// devilishly creative mind just one example....
// this is a simple passthough script i tossed on paper
// what does this do for you die hard arcane mages or scripted up archer mage?
// why it does little else but remove your arcane staff when used as a passthough 
// script on the same binds as either your paralyze or invis + an auto tab war
// block to instantly tab out of combat upon using invis to keep from hittin mobs 
// or accidently freeing a paralyzed enemy
