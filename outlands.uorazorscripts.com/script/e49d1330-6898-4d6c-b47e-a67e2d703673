# Based on a script by Jaseowns
# First version 1.0 2023/05/04
#
# What to expect:
#   training herding, spirit speak and necromancy from 80 to 120
# What you need:
#   a book of necromancy, a shepherds crook,
#   a spellbook with Fireball and Fire Elemental,
#   at least 80 Magery to cast Fire Elemental (better 100),
#   a lot of black pearls to cast a lot of fireballs,
#   100 of bloodmoss, mandrake root, spider silk and sulfurous ash for fire elemental.
#   restock reagents manually if needed.
# Ho to use:
#   Have 100 INT, 100 Magery, and 80 Herding-SpiritSpeak-Necromancy before starting is suggested.
#   80 Meditation at least.
#   Go to prevalia zoo, or your preferred training spot, and start the script.
