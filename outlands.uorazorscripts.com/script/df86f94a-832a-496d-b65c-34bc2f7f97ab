## Script: Ultimate Recall (Recall, Runetome, Runebook, Chivalry)
## Created by: special_sy#0
#############################################

# Made by Chumber
# Based on https://outlands.uorazorscripts.com/script/fb2d9f3c-0f8a-4de6-b8f3-f5c07b790d8c
# Expanded with the runetome and swapped the order (runebook before chiv)
# Added all follow me if you got followers
# Recall runetome target added, runetome|runebook|rune put into one if
# Also added a var you can set in other scripts to deactivate the escape...
# 2052-06-06    Updated with [recall and [recallCharge
#               Reduced Moongate range check so it wont prevent recalling anymore
#  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATER YOUR RUNE NAME, CTRL+H replace 
#  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DoS with whatever your escape Rune is named
