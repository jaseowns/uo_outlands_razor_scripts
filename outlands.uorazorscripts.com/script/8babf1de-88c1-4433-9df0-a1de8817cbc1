# Train Veterinary to your max skill By Jaseowns
# UO Outlands
# Nabolas' updated Vet training for Tamer/Mage
# The script just didn't work very well when you have no melee combat.
# Changed the script up to work for a Tamer/Mage, uses magic arrow to deal dmg to the pet.
# Load up on Sulfurous Ash and bandages.
