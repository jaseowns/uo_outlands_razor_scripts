# Training Meditation/Spirit Speak up to 120 By SplashGxR
# V1 2024-11-20
# This is a bit more of a simple script to run
# You can change "Meditation" < 100 for "Spirit Speak" < 120 in Line 10
# Depending on what skill you would like to level
# I'd recommend an Avarhide Satchel to reduce the use of regs
# Will update regs needed depending on discovery!
