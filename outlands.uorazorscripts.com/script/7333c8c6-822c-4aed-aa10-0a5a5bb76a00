# Fast Travel by Alcon
# Use Moongate, Magery, Chivalry, or Camping to travel to a specified location using one button.
# Works on multiple characters if they have their Favorite rune in the same slot of their respective books.
# Last Edited 12/10/24
# Includes changes to Camping/Hiking


#/#/# IMPORTANT #/#/#
# There is a feature that automatically uses a Recall scroll if you are out of reagents
# Relevant characters must have a cooldown named Regs with a Trigger for Overhead Message:
# More reagents are needed for this spell
# Recommend that the cooldown be 10 seconds
// After additional testing I've found that in some cases the hotkey needs to be pressed multiple times for the switch to happen, haven't found a fix yet.
