# Copy Runebook Script by Jaseowns
# UO Outlands - video coming soon...
# Requirements: two runebooks, one filled one blank - enough blank runes and regs to mark/recall
# By default the runelist is 26 long (full runetome)
# You can remove the list elements from runes_to_copy_list
# Additional Info: 
#   This script removes a rune from your "from" runetome, recalls to that location
#   and use the description of that rune.  Once it recalls, it will attempt to Mark
#   a blank rune and rename based on that description
#   Assuming all goes well, it puts both runes back
#   WARNING: if your runes are unsafe locations, this may fail.
# References:
#   // marked rune
#   // recall rune 7956 0
#   // unmarked rune
#   // recall rune 7956 2882
