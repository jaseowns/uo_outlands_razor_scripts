    /////////////////
    //    TIPS:    //
    /////////////////

    //    Disclaimer:  I AM NOT AN EXPERT!  I have only played Outlands for a little under 2 years now (with 90% of the first year spent harvesting - main PVM account is only at 15 links) 
    //    This is also the first and only MMO I have played since I last logged out of my OSI accounts on Great Lakes shard back in 2003.  
    //    So take any of my advice with that in mind - I am still a noob.  If you have 30+ links and millions of gold, there is probably a better way to do things, but this works for me at my stage!
    //    I have zero prior experience scripting and I have made these primarily for my own benefit!!  I am learning as I go...
    //    Mostly, I make these scripts in order to play on my Asus ROG Ally handheld - but I have come to enjoy the challenge of making them work for as many builds as possible.
    //    I do not really use Discord (I only installed it to join Outlands - then discovered I had an older account already).  Lots of people message me there, but I rarely check it (sorry).
    //    That being said, I do my best to fix reported bugs (dan@danstockman.com) but usually do not have time to respond to requests for custom stuff (but appreciate any ideas, for sure!)
    //    Since I do not personally use all aspects of the script (and do all my editing in Notepad on my PC at work lol) some bugs take longer for me to find - but I am always adjusting and updating!  Thanks for being patient!
    //    If you see me out in Avadon, my apologies if I dont respond (its a pain to type on the ROG Ally), but to do enjoy hearing that people use my scripts.  Appreciate the support!  GOOD LUCK OUT THERE :)


#         IMPT: FIRST RUN OF SCRIPT SHOULD BE DONE IN HOUSE/INN ROOM AND TAKES ROUGHLY 15 SECONDS TO COMPLETE INITIAL (ONE TIME) SETUP!
#             Initial setup can be redone by setting 'ResetScriptPermanentVariables' variable to '1' below!
#         Or you can re-target script variables individually in the 'Options' tab above the script
#
#     Use the skill template above along with ARCANE ASPECT WEAPON and ARCANE CODEX (LEECH stance, DRAIN finsher and LEYLINE ability for maximum MANA generation)
#     Aspect armour can be ARCANE, ELDRITCH, BLOOD, FROST or your choice - I used ARCANE until it was level 10 and then switched to FROST for the protection (and I am Glacier lol)
#     Recommend use of MELEE ASPECT CHANCE chain links to increase MANA THIEF proc chance on ARCANE ASPECT weapon (and then DAMAGE TO DISEASED chain links, etc.)
#     Eating delectable FOOD (w/ cooking skill) will restore HP and MANA (w/ 60 second cooldown) 
#     Eating MUSHROOMS with the Wizards Grimoire will also restore MANA (60-180 second cooldown)
#     Once ARCANE CODEX and ARCANE ASPECT WEAPON are sufficiently levelled PLATEMAIL ARMOUR can be used and no meditation skills will be necessary
#     Recommend prioritizing CREATE FOOD and (at first) MANA DRAIN spells in WIZARDS GRIMOIRE before moving on to other spells (ie. FLAMESTRIKE, XPLOS, EBLOT, etc.)
#     Use www.outlandsbutler.com (or 'PLAYER STATS' page) to make sure you are hitting your MANA REFUND CAP (early build may require use of MANA DRAIN spell) 
#     Recommend PARRY CODEX stances of BULWARK or SHIELD BASH w/ LAST STAND finisher - auto switching options are available based on war mode and buff status
#     Script displays lots of OVERHEAD MESSAGES by default - these can be disabled in the variable section (minimal target indicators remain - it is my preferred mode!)
#     Recommend using Razor TEXT FILTERS to cancel redundant system messages and Razor spam
#     Script has optional COOLDOWNS you can add (see list below) but they are NOT required for script function - just handy to display on bars in your U.I.
#     Script uses ORGANIZER AGENT-01 for optional MAIN INVENTORY pouch organization (can be set to auto select your main bag in inventory reset below)
#     If enabled AUTO RECALL triggers when RED is within target range (~12 tiles) or when WEIGHT LIMIT is reached in WILDERNESSMODE (optional DIY script usage, as well)
#     If enabled and RED is targeted (~12 tiles) in DUNGEONMODE (or WEIGHT LIMIT reached) script will use DUNGEON ESCAPE mode to locate and activate MOONGATES while keeping you alive
#     If enabled POTIONS will be automatically consumed as needed and MANUAL POTION USE MAY DISRUPT SCRIPT TIMING (turn off script potions if manual hotkey is preferred)
#     If enabled LOOT CHEST in your HOME/INN/BANK is used store goods, script uses ORGANIZER AGENTS 06-09 as sub-containers you can set inside the chest to organize items further
#     If enabled and WOODEN BOX and COPPER KEY found in inventory, script will automactially store and lock any looted items when not in combat (ignores Arcane Staves to prevent losing weapon)
#     Script allows for manual selection of CODEX STANCES in the variable section below (or you can enable AUTOMATIC STANCE SWITCHING instead)
#     If AUTO ARCANE CODEX stance switching is enabled:  WAR = LEECH/DRAIN  PEACE = SURGE/DRAIN  poisoned/bleeding/diseased/lowhp = SHIELD/CATALYST
#     If AUTO PARRY CODEX stance switching is enabled:   WAR = SHIELD BASH/LAST STAND  PEACE = BULWARK/LAST STAND  poisoned/bleeding/diseased/lowhp = WARDING/BARRIER
#     If you die the DEATH LOOP will auto select moongates and travel to last gated town and then waits to auto-select the resurrection gump when a HEALER is located
#     If enabled a DRESS LIST of your [blessed] wearables will be equipped after resurrection (must be named 'UltimateArcaneMage')
#     If enabled after resurrection script can recall home (requires scrolls in [blessed] runebook), resupply, heal, activate aspect and even setup your pack with pouch stacks, etc.
#     If enabled INVENTORY RESET will stack trapped pouches on your main inventory pouch (after putting scissors inside to protect them from shelf restocking) and then hide the stack
#     MANY FEATURES ARE TURNED 'OFF' BY DEFAULT!  MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE VARIABLE SECTION BELOW CLOSELY PRIOR TO FIRST USE!!
#     This script is a compilation of many existing scripts married to my own new stuff, but big thanks to user dennozz for many features I learned from studying their scripts!


#     I believe everything is FINALLY working as intended.  Hopefully build version 1.1.4 is the final product, but always check back for new updates!!
#     I am pretty stoked with where the script is as of Nov 2025. It has come a loooong way and, at least for my own purposes, is 100% functional.
#     Let me know if you find any mistakes that I missed (dan@danstockman.com) or if there is anything that needs to be added.  Good luck and thanks for your support.
