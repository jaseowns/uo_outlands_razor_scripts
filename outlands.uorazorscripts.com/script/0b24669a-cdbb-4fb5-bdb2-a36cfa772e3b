# Tinkering Crafting Queue and Sell Jewelry by Jaseowns
# UO Outlands
# Updated 9/28/2024 to re-handle item count change
# Updated 7/10/2023 to handle Camping (let me know if it breaks)
# Requirements:
#    Magery and a desire to use the crafting queue
#    Two runes or rune books 
#       - one default location to your house (must be in backpack)
#       - other to tinker vendor (must be accessible while at home)
#    Sell Agent Enabled with Beads/Necklace
#    A bunch of recall Regs (i am not checking to restock)
# Description:
#    Setup the crafting queue https://uooutlands.com/wiki/Tinkering#Training
#    As you finish making beads, make sure those are on your SELL agent.
#    Make sure the SELL agent is enabled, you should only need to target one bead
#    Make sure to select one necklace when you get that far as well
#   
#    This script assumes you are recalling to a spot where you can run the
#    Crafting Queue without needing to move your character (Courtyard anyone?)
#    If you need to move your character, you can manually do that or add 
#    walk movements to the area it says "I am lost"
#
#    The script checks for your house X/Y position that you set on line 30/31
#    It also needs to know your Vendor rune X/Y position on line 33/34
#
#    Once you recall to your vendor rune, it will ask for the vendor to sell too
#    After all these steps are setup, the script will continue to loop between
#    Running the crafting queue and then selling when 120 items is met
#    
#    I try to handle being out of regs or not knowing where you are.. but goodluck!
