## Script: Throw nets at an SOS / MIB spot, spyglass, heal
## Created by: dabiri#0
#############################################

// This is solid but not perfect. I'm out of MIBs and not planning much fishing in the short term, so decided to share the current state.
// It will heal, cure, spyglass, and throw nets at a nearby SOS spot. The color of net can be specified on line 60.
// I like to launch it with a CUO macro that also triggers mariners fortune greater ability before calling the script

// This script expects you to have cooldowns named EXACTLY:
# Holy Light
# Fishing Net
# Spyglass
