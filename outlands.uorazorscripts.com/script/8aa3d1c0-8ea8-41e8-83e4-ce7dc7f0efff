## Script: Mage Tamer Self and Pet Buffs
## Created by: mrblump#0
#############################################

# Script by Blumpy
# Simple script for mage tamers to buff themselves and pets. It does rely on you having at least 1 point in bless in the Wizard's Grimoire.
# At the time of creating this script blessing your pets was flagged as criminal healing so I toggle the setting on and off in the script.
