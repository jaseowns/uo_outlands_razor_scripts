## Created by: texecutioner187#0
#############################################

# Training Cartography from Cambria, Credit to Jaseowns(of course) for the original script, I just modified the mapmaker and city based on input from Ian to save manual edits
# UO Outlands = https://youtu.be/k5oVW2HwJi8
# Requirements:  Tons of blank maps, 40+ map maker pens
#   restock agent 5   as      10 maps and 2 map maker pens
#   sell agent        as      map and enabled
####
# UPDATED September 17th 2022 to no longer need counters
####
#   Put your max skill on line 10 if you want to go beyond 100 skill.
