## Script: ULTIMATE HERDING New Focus Agro Use Crook
## Created by: slackermandan#0
#############################################

#As of the Jan 13 2024 patch, focus agro use has changed
#Now, it is turned on by double clicking the crook and it stays on and bonuses are applied to all followers against all targets
#Meaning you don't need to re-use the skill on each mob
#This script checks if focus agro is active, and if it is not active it turns it on
#This does not work if your crook is in a locked box,
#Trapped pouch doesn't work reliably, Razor forgets the crook is in it :(
