    # 0 ... Kill all negativ effects without considering collateral damage to (potentially stronger) positive effects   (faster, uses more resources)
    # 1 ... Kill negativ effects only if they outweigh positive effects, avoid unneccessary collateral damage           (slower, uses less resources)
    # Note: fungicides and farmer almanacs remove buffs and debuffs in a random fashion. With gardeningSmartMode set to 1 the script is going to ignore fungal and creature debuffs as long as there are stronger corresponding buffs in place
