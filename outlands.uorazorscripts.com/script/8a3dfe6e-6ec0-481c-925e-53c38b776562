## Script: Organize Special Fishing Nets
## Created by: dabiri#0
#############################################

//This script should dump special fishing nets into a pre-defined box while leaving non special fishing nets in your bag. I use it as part of a much more significant control-shift-owyn style script

clearignore 
// Set this to the serial of the box you want to dump the nets into
@setvar! gold_box '0x42B2CD0B'

while findtype "fishing net" backpack as net
    getlabel net netname
    if "special" in netname
        overhead 'Found a special net'
        lift net 60000
        drop gold_box -1 -1 0
        wait 650
