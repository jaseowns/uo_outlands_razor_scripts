    //    CHANGE LOG:    //

    /////////////////
    //    TIPS:    //
    /////////////////

    //    Disclaimer:  I AM NOT AN EXPERT!  I have only played Outlands for a little under 2 years now (with 90% of the first year spent harvesting - main PVM account is only at 15 links) 
    //    This is also the first and only MMO I have played since I last logged out of my OSI accounts on Great Lakes shard back in 2003.  
    //    So take any of my advice with that in mind - I am still a noob.  If you have 30+ links and millions of gold, there is probably a better way to do things, but this works for me at my stage!
    //    I have zero prior experience scripting and I have made these primarily for my own benefit!!  I am learning as I go...
    //    Mostly, I make these scripts in order to play on my Asus ROG Ally handheld - but I have come to enjoy the challenge of making them work for as many builds as possible.
    //    I do not really use Discord (I only installed it to join Outlands - then discovered I had an older account already).  Lots of people message me there, but I rarely check it (sorry).
    //    That being said, I do my best to fix reported bugs (dan@danstockman.com) but usually do not have time to respond to requests for custom stuff (but appreciate any ideas, for sure!)
    //    Since I do not personally use all aspects of the script (and do all my editing in Notepad on my PC at work lol) some bugs take longer for me to find - but I am always adjusting and updating!  Thanks for being patient!
    //    If you see me out in Avadon, my apologies if I dont respond (its a pain to type on the ROG Ally), but to do enjoy hearing that people use my scripts.  Appreciate the support!  GOOD LUCK OUT THERE :)


#         IMPT: FIRST RUN OF SCRIPT SHOULD BE DONE IN HOUSE/INN ROOM AND TAKES ROUGHLY 15 SECONDS TO COMPLETE INITIAL (ONE TIME) SETUP!
#             Initial setup can be redone by setting 'ResetScriptPermanentVariables' variable to '1' below!
#             Or you can re-target script variables individually in the 'Options' tab above the script
#
#       The skill template at the top is what I am using, but not the only way to do things.  I am new to summoning myself, so do your own research!
#       Using the STATS page in the U.I. or (much easier) the OUTLANDS BUTLER site make sure you are maximizing and reaching your mana refund cap (or other template goals)
#       Recommend use of MEDITATION RATE chain links, DAMAGED TO DISEASED chain links and SPELL ASPECT CHANCE chain links (if going spell-based summoner route)
#       Eating MUSHROOMS with the Wizards Grimoire will restore MANA (60-180 second cooldown) if you have 6 points in CREATE FOOD
#       Otherwise, I would prioritize Flamestrike, Mindblast, Lightning, Magic Arrow, Fireball, etc. in your WIZARDS GRIMOIRE (or Mana Drain if needed to reach mana refund cap)
#       Script displays lots of OVERHEAD MESSAGES by default - these can be disabled in the variable section (minimal target indicators remain - it is my preferred mode!)
#       Recommend using Razor TEXT FILTERS to cancel redundant system messages and Razor spam
#       Script has optional COOLDOWNS you can add (see list below) but they are NOT required for script function - just handy to display on bars in your U.I.
#       Script uses ORGANIZER AGENT-01 for optional MAIN INVENTORY pouch organization (can be set to auto select your main bag in inventory reset below)
#       If enabled AUTO RECALL triggers when RED is within target range (~12 tiles) or when WEIGHT LIMIT is reached in WILDERNESSMODE (optional DIY script usage, as well)
#       If enabled and RED is targeted (~12 tiles) in DUNGEONMODE (or WEIGHT LIMIT reached) script will use DUNGEON ESCAPE mode to locate and activate MOONGATES while keeping you alive
#       If enabled POTIONS will be automatically consumed as needed and optionally can refill pots from KEGS to reduce carry weight (and increase potion quantities) 
#       If enabled LOOT CHEST in your HOME/INN/BANK is used store goods, script uses ORGANIZER AGENTS 06-09 as sub-containers you can set inside the chest to organize items further
#       If enabled and WOODEN BOX and COPPER KEY found in inventory, script will automactially store and lock any looted items when not in combat
#       If you die the DEATH LOOP will auto select moongates and travel to last gated town and then waits to auto-select the resurrection gump when a HEALER is located
#       If enabled a DRESS LIST of your [blessed] wearables will be equipped after resurrection (dress list must be named 'UltimateSummoner')
#       If enabled after resurrection script can recall home (requires scrolls in [blessed] runebook), resupply, heal, activate aspects and even setup your pack with pouch stacks, etc.
#       If enabled INVENTORY RESET will stack trapped pouches on your main inventory pouch (after putting scissors inside to protect them from shelf restocking) and then hide the stack
#       MANY FEATURES ARE TURNED 'OFF' BY DEFAULT!  MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE VARIABLE SECTION BELOW CLOSELY PRIOR TO FIRST USE!!
#       This script is a compilation of many existing scripts married to my own new stuff, but BIG thanks to user dennozz for many features I learned from studying their scripts!
