## Script: Bapeth's Wizard Hat Stealth Trick
## Created by: barryroser#0
#############################################

# Bapeths Wizard Hat Stealth Trick
#
# October 7th 2024
#
# This script is uses a "Magical Wizards Hat Hot Swap" with your normal hat in order to artificially reduce stamina when it hits max.  
# This prevents the user from stepping on a mob/player while in stealth (even if the player/mob is in stealth/hidden themselves)
#
# "Required"
# A magical wizards hat (the type that changes your stats) in your backpack
# An otherwise non-magical wizard hat (any hat you like to wear, i.e., your main drip)

# "Action Delay Setting"
# This script uses razor "Auto-Queue Object Delay" setting
# Make sure this setting is turned ON in the razor Options tab > Targeting & Queues sub-tab
# Set "object delay to 503" - Hat swap will be slow if you do not do this
#
# "Errors & Resetting hats"
# Navigate to the Script Options Tab
# Delete "bwiz" "bmain" and "nonaspectedwiz" from the list
# Play the script again
#
# Script starts here
