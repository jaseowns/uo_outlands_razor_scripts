@clearignore 
# Script by [DoS] Chumber
# This script is a semi automatic helper if you train tinkering
# with jewels. 
# 
# It stops the queue if full and resumes after unload
# It will work with any jeweler, just be in range (10 tiles)
# It can buy tools if you setup a buy agent for them
# Just change buyToolkits to 1
#
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# !! REQUIREMENTS:                                                    !!
# !! Add the beads to your sell agent and enable it                   !!
# !! Add 5 toolkits to your buy agent and enable it                   !!
# !! Setup your crafting queue with beads (craft until skill reached) !!
# !! This Script uses Organizer 10 to move gold, usually your         !!
# !! boombox or your bank where possible (Outpost)                    !!
# !! Setup Restock Agent 10 to grab ingots and jewels                 !!
