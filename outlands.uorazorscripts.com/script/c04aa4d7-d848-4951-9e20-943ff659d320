## Script: Ressource Map Helper (Lumber, Mining, Skinning, Fishing)
## Created by: special_sy#0
#############################################

# Script by [DoS] Chumber
# !! For fishing create a dress called Fishing with your pole equiped !!
# !! Uses script 'Routines\Miner Recall' to recall afterwards !!
# Works with a SINGLE ressource map in your backpack
# Just go to the spot (or near it) and start the script 
# It will equip the right tool and start looking for the cart
