#UO Unchained
#INSTRUCTIONS: Buy Tinker skill up to 42 from Calvin the Tinker directly North of Brit Bank
              #Buy one Tinker's Tools from Calvin. I used this tool to make my first tool kit to train with
              #Have ingots and tool kit in your backpack click play
              #If you have below 45 skill this will make tool kits so make sure your bag is mostly empty
              #Leave all the tool kits in your bag as you will use them going from 45-100 skill
