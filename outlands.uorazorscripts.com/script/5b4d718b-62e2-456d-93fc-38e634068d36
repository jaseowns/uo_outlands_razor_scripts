## Created by: barryroser#0
#############################################

# Bapeths Invis + Detect Degeneracy
#
# Create a cooldown in your UO options called "Detect Hidden" and create 3 Sys Message Triggers 10 seconds each
# "You search the home and find no one hiding within -- Cooldown : 10"
# "You search the area but find nothing hidden -------- Cooldown : 10"
# "You reveal what was hidden ------------------------- Cooldown : 10" 
# Do not include quotations
#
# "In Warmode" :
# Play the script to enable auto invis
# You have 1.5 seconds to target the detect before the script drops invis on self
# If you fail to target detect in this time, the script will target your center before invis
#
# "In Peacemode" :
# The script will act as a normal detect hidden skill use
