# Be in your room/house with two pets. Name one "a" & equip a low damage weapon (not your Crook as that gives extra damage. Goal here is to harm your target pet enough so they don't regenerate on their own so you can heal, but not enough that they die if you fail healing them
# Set max skill limit to train to. Minor Lore gains as well.
