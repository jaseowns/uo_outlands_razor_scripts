## Created by: barryroser#0
#############################################

# Bapeths Manual Override
#
# Script will loop into "Master Background", "Bapeths Modern Dungeon Picker", or "Bapeths Stabber Background" if you have it in your script library
#
# To clear Manual Override, play the script then stop it / cancel your target before selecting anything
#
# Use this script in place of your "Set Last Target" hotkey 
#
# Script starts here
