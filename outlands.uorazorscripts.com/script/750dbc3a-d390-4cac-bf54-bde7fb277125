    /////////////////
    //    TIPS:    //
    /////////////////

    //    Disclaimer:  I AM NOT AN EXPERT!  I have only played Outlands for 2 years now (with 90% of the first year spent harvesting - main PVM account is only at 16 links) 
    //    This is also the first and only MMO I have played since I last logged out of my OSI accounts on Great Lakes shard back in 2003.  
    //    So take any of my advice with that in mind - I am still a noob. If you have 30+ links and millions of gold, there is probably a better way to do things, but this works for me at my stage!
    //    I have zero prior experience scripting and I have made these primarily for my own benefit!!  I am learning as I go...
    //    Mostly, I make these scripts in order to play on my Asus ROG Ally handheld - but I have come to enjoy the challenge of making them work for as many builds as possible.
    //    I do not really use Discord (I only installed it to join Outlands - then discovered I had an older account already).  Lots of people message me there, but I rarely check it (sorry).
    //    That being said, I do my best to fix reported bugs (dan@danstockman.com) but usually do not have time to respond to requests for custom stuff (but appreciate any ideas, for sure!)
    //    Since I do not personally use all aspects of the script (and do all my editing in Notepad on my PC at work lol) some bugs take longer for me to find - but I am always adjusting and updating!  Thanks for being patient!
    //    If you see me out in Avadon, my apologies if I dont respond (its a pain to type on the ROG Ally), but to do enjoy hearing that people use my scripts.  Appreciate the support!  GOOD LUCK OUT THERE :)

        
      
#     Another short QOL script that I use along with my Auto Pilots - this one is handy if you close your hidden inventory bags by accident
#     This is a companion script to my others which will open your main inventory pouch after it has been buried under trapped pouches
#     It will ignore empty pouches and pouches with only 1 item in order to avoid opening trapped pouches by mistake
#     Script will also optionally open your potion satchel, wizard satchel (ignores decorative), loot bag and lockboxs if enabled below
