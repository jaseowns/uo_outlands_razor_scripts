/////// DANSTOCK'S ULTIMATE HARVESTING AUTO PILOT SCRIPT
/////   UO Outlands Razor script - Last updated May 26, 2024 (email any bug reports/tips to dan@danstockman.com) 
///     Created by DanStock.


# This is a MEGA combination of the two harvesting scripts (MINING & LUMBERJACKING) that I have compiled over the first few months of playing Outlands.  I'm learning as I go...
# I managed to get to 120 Lumberjacking and (working on) 120 Mining using these scripts and I found it to be the best money maker for a new player.
# Using this script, even a brand new player should be able to get up and running with relative ease!
# Rather than have seperate scripts for each skill, I combined them both so only one hotkey is needed - regardless of which character or Echo (multi skill chars can toggle one or the other below).
# I tried to include as much information and tips as possible - and made everything changeable via VARIABLES.  READ SCRIPT FOR DETAILS!!

### Good luck and HAPPY HARVESTING!! ###

////// ANYTIME YOU NEED TO RESET OR CHANGE PERMANENT VARIABLES (ie. ESCAPE RUNEBOOKS, INGOT BAG AND BOARD BAG): ////// 
    # Run script once with this ALLVARIABLERESET set to 1 to clear ALL variables. 
    # Then reset ALLVARIABLERESET to 0 and restart script to prompt for new targets!
    

    @setvar! ALLVARIABLERESET 0

/////// Anti-PK Mining MEGA script w/ Auto Recall (using charged rune book) and Auto Smelting
/////   Created by DanStock - Pax Augustus of Terran


//      Auto MINING script with colour coded overhead messages for all scenarios.  Clean UI with some RPG elements.
//      Auto SMELTING when next to any PLAYER-BUILT FORGE - and 5 second intervals to check for NATURAL FORGES (modify time under variable section).
//      Auto healing with BANDAGES as well as auto HEAL, REFRESH and CURE POTIONS as needed.
//      Auto open trapped POUCH if PARALYZED.
//      Auto buff checks and activation for TRACKING and FOOD SATISFACTION.
//      Auto RECALL if RED player tracked/engaged (using charged runebook).     
//      Auto TARGET & ATTACK greys if WAR MODE engaged - restarts auto-harvest script once coast is clear! 
//      Auto INGOT RECALL if more than 2000 total ingots in inventory (modify amount under variable section ).
//      Auto ORGANIZING and anti-theft with AGENT-11, AGENT-06, AGENT-04 and AGENT-03 (modify to your own preference).
//      Auto INVENTORY checks with overhead messages if anything is low or out of stock (modify under variable section).


# Ideal skill template for this script:
    # Mining (50-120) 
    # Macing/Tactics/Anatomy/Camping (100)
    # Healing/Tracking (80)
    # Magic resist (40)

    
# Required (or suggested *) inventory items:
    # Pickaxes
    # Escape runebook charged w/ recall scrolls
    # Weapon (war mace or quarter staff are my preference)
    # Bandages
    # Trapped pouches
    # Healing, Cure and Refresh potions (strength, agility and magic resist pots help too *)
    # Skinning knife *
    # Adventurers rope *
    # Cheese (or fish steaks) *
    # A blessed codex of Macing *
    # A blessed codex of Healing *
    # Harvest Aspect leather armour *

    # Organizer Agent-11 hotbag (for ingots - can be trapped pouch for added security)
    # Organizer Agent-04 hotbag (for main inventory - I use a hidden stack of trapped pouches to deter theives and set this as the bottom one)
    # Organizer Agent-03 hotbag * (optional - for gold, grid loot, etc.)
    # Organizer Agent-06 hotbag * (optional - for unloading loot & ingots at home/inn room)
    

    // To further clean things up, I highly suggest using some filters for repeated system/overhead messages //

### System messages to filter in Razor: ###

    // "What do you want to use this item on?"
    // "You do not see any harvestable resources nearby."
    // "You do not see any nearby forges"
    // "You smelt the ore"
    // "You dig some"
    // "You loosen some"
    // "Mining skillgain"
    // "No one matching that"
    // "Organize Agent"
    // "queued"
    // "Macro"
    // "Achievement"
    // "Your food satisfaction"
    // "You have worn out your tool"


# Please also add the following COOLDOWNS (case sensitive) in UO client under Options -> Cooldowns:
    // Healing Potion
    // Cure Potion 
    // Refresh Potion
    // Magic Shield *

 
# TIPS:    
// Auto healing with bandages/potions script is running at all times.  Modify potion set points under variable section.
/// Will swap to WEAPON, target nearest grey and attack if WAR MODE is manually engaged - good for dealing with basic wilderness MOBs.
//// Auto tracking skill check and activation. Will automatically select proper settings for RED ALERT trigger.
///// RED ALERT trigger also applies auto bandages, modifies potion set points and will POP trapped pouches if paralized while trying to escape - makes you very hard to kill 1 vs. 1!
////// Set Organizer-11 for ingots (can be a trapped pouch for added protection - but, if so, disable pouch opening under variable section).  
/////// Organizer-04 for main items (pots, bandages, weapons, tools, etc.) and optional Organizer-03 for gold, loot, etc.
//////// Set Orgnanizer-06 as a secure storage container in your house or inn room for unloading ingots, loot, etc.
///////// Set Escape runebook first time using script. Change 'gumpresponse' input for specific rune targets below (default input 2 will target the first rune in the book).
////////// Setup hotkeys for running this script and another for stopping all scripts and that should be all you need!
/////////// The only thing that stops the script are periodic Captcha checks. Otherwise, you just move around on auto pilot (and simply toggle WAR MODE if you need to attack something). 
//////////// I also setup a hotkey for ROPE, which I find useful for evading PKs or MOBs.

##  NEW PLAYERS:  If starting a new character/account, disable auto recall until you have a blessed/charged runebook (worth ~60-70k gp) in your inventory.  
##  Use the script to harvest 5,000+ iron ore, turn it into a commodity and sell it on Discord or through a player vendor to fund initial build items.
##  Use the newbie dungeon on Shelter Island to build skills to 80 (tactics, anatomy, macing, healing, tracking and camping), then macro on a battle trainer to 100.  Quick and cheap to level up!
##  Enable auto attack, bandage healing, auto potions, etc. once your build/budget allows.
##  This script will allow for growth via the user variables below until eventually the full script is used.  
##  Script is very effective against Red PKs with either successful auto recall or auto bandages/pots keeping you alive long enough to evade or fight back!

/////// Anti-PK Lumberjacking MEGA script w/ Auto Recall (using charged rune book)
/////   Created by DanStock - Ragnar Volarus of Terran


//      Auto LUMBERJACKING script with colour coded overhead messages for all scenarios.  Clean UI with some RPG elements.
//      Auto healing with BANDAGES as well as auto HEAL, REFRESH and CURE POTIONS as needed.
//      Auto trapped POUCH if PARALYZED.
//      Auto buff checks and activation for TRACKING and FOOD SATISFACTION.
//      Auto RECALL if RED player tracked/engaged (using charged runebook).   
//      Auto BOARD RECALL if more than 3000 total boards in inventory (modify amount under variable section ).  
//      Auto TARGET & ATTACK greys if WAR MODE engaged - restarts harvesting script once coast is clear! 
//      Auto ORGANIZING and anti-theft with AGENT-01, AGENT-02, AGENT-03 and AGENT-06 (modify to your own preference).
//      Auto INVENTORY checks with overhead messages if anything is low or out of stock (modify under variable section).


# Ideal skills template for this script:
    # Lumberjacking (50-120) 
    # Swords/Tactics/Anatomy/Healing/Tracking (100)
    # Magery (60) 
    # Resist spells (40)

    
# Required inventory items:
    # Hatchets
    # A blessed escape runebook charged w/ recall scrolls
    # Trapped pouches 
    # Weapon (Double or two handed axe is my preference)
    # Bandages
    # Healing, Cure and Refresh potions (strength, agility and magic resist pots help too *)
    # Skinning knife *
    # Cheese (or fish steaks) *
    # Adventurers rope *
    # A blessed codex of Macing *
    # A blessed codex of Healing *
    # Harvest Aspect leather armour *

    # Organizer Agent-01 hotbag   (for boards, logs, seeds, etc.)
    # Organizer Agent-02 hotbag   (for main inventory - I use a hidden stack of trapped pouches to deter theives and set this as the bottom one)
    # Organizer Agent-03 hotbag * (optional - for gold, grid loot, etc.)
    # Organizer Agent-06 hotbag * (optional - for unloading loot & boards at home/inn room)
    

// To clean things up, I highly recommend adding text filters to filter out the following system messages in Razor //

    // "You shape the logs into boards."
    // "You chop some"
    // "You do not see any harvestable resources nearby."
    // "You cannot produce any wood from that.
    // "You hack at the tree"
    // "Lumberjacking skillgain"
    // "What do you want to use this item on?"
    // "Organize Agent"
    // "queued"
    // "Target queue cleared"
    // "Macro"
    // "Achievement"
    // "Your food satisfaction"

      
# Please also add the following COOLDOWNS (case sensitive) in UO client under Options -> Cooldowns:
    // Healing Potion
    // Cure Potion 
    // Refresh Potion
    // Magic Shield

 
# TIPS:    
// Auto healing with bandages/potions script is running at all times.  Modify potion set points under variable section.
/// Will swap to WEAPON, target nearest grey and attack if WAR MODE is manually engaged - good for dealing with basic wilderness MOBs.
//// Auto tracking skill check and activation. Will automatically select proper settings for RED ALERT trigger.
///// RED ALERT trigger also applies auto bandages, modifies potion set points and will POP trapped pouches if paralized while trying to escape - makes you very hard to kill 1 vs. 1!
////// Set Organizer-01 for boards, logs and seeds (can be a trapped pouch for added protection - but, if so, disable pouch opening under variable section).  
/////// Organizer-02 for main items (pots, bandages, weapons, tools, etc.) and optional Organizer-03 for gold, loot, etc.
//////// Set Orgnanizer-06 as a secure storage container in your house or inn room for unloading ingots, loot, etc.
///////// Set Escape runebook first time using script. Change 'gumpresponse' input for specific rune targets below (default input 2 will target the first rune in the book).
////////// Setup hotkeys for running this script (I use "Mouse Wheel Up") and another for stopping all scripts (I use "Mouse Wheel Down") and that should be all you need!
/////////// The only thing that stops the script are periodic Captcha checks. Otherwise, you just move around on auto pilot (and simply enable WAR MODE if you need to fight something).

##  NEW PLAYERS:  If starting a new character/account, disable auto recall until you have a blessed/charged runebook (worth ~60-70k gp) in your inventory.  
##  Use the script to harvest 5,000-10,000 boards, turn them into commodities and sell them on Discord or through a player vendor to fund initial build items.
##  Use the newbie dungeon on Shelter Island to build skills to 80 (tactics, anatomy, swords, healing and tracking), then macro on a battle trainer to 100.  Quick and cheap to level up!
##  Enable auto attack, bandage healing, auto potions, etc. once your build/budget allows.
##  This script will allow for growth via the user variables below until eventually the full script is used.  Makes money quickly!
##  Script is very effective against Red PKs with either successful auto recall or auto bandages/pots keeping you alive long enough to evade or fight back!
