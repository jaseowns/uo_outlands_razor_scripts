## Script: backstabberAttack
## Created by: tarouca#0
#############################################

# THIS SCRIPT DEPENDS FROM:
# SCRIPTS: backstabberSetup
# COOLDOWNS: Tactics, Weapon Ability, Smoke Bomb, Health Potion, Hiding, Rope
# TO SET THIS COOLDOWNS:
# PAPERDOLL > OPTIONS > COOLDOWNS > NEW ENTRY
# ALL COOLDOWNS SHOULD BE SET AS MENTIONED (Tactics, Weapon Ability, Smoke Bomb, Health Potion, Hiding, Rope)
# ON EACH CHECK: HIDE WHEN INACTIVE, PAUSE DURING WORLD SAVE
# MOUNT TOKEN

# OVERHEAD MESSAGES ARE USEFUL
# TO SETUP OVERHEAD MESSAGES:
# RAZOR > DISPLAY/COUNTERS > OVERHEAD MESSAGES
# CHECK: SHOW
# ADD MESSAGE FOR: stealth steps remaining. WITH OVERHEAD OF: {3} STEPS
# ADD MESSAGE FOR: You feel ready to continue stealthing. WITH OVERHEAD OF: RENEWED
# ADD MESSAGE FOR: You will automatically stealth when out of steps. WITH OVERHEAD OF: RENEWED

# TO SETUP ENSURE YOU EDIT THE backstabberSetup SCRIPT
# ADJUST THE lagTimer_ TO YOUR LIKING OR LEAVE IT AS IS
# ADJUST THE smokeBombCooldown_ TO REFLECT YOUR COOLDOWN (120000 IS THE BASE)
# ADJUST THE useMagery_ TO 0 IF TEMPLATE HAS MAGERY < 60
# IF MAGERY >= 60 INVISIBILITY SCROLLS ARE NEEDED
# REGARDING SERIALS REPLACE XXXXXXXXXX BY THE SERIALS OF YOUR ITEMS:
# IF NOT USING 2 WEAPON SKILLS, SET THE myBow_ WITH THE SAME VALUE AS myMace_
# A MAGICAL WIZARD HAT IS NEEDED TO KEEP A DIFFERENCE IN STAMINA SO THAT ON MOVEMENT CHARACTER WONT GET OUT OF STEALTH
# SET SERIALS FOR: myMount_, myHeadPiece_, myWizardHat_, myMace_, myBow_

#ATTACK
# UNCOMMENT EVERY CARDINAL BELOW TO GET A CONTIGENGY ON ATTACK.
# THIS CONTIGENCY PREVENTS YOU FROM INSTANTLY ATTACKING IF YOU RUN THE SCRIPT ATTACK ON TOP OF YOUR TARGET.
# YOU WILL HAVE TO GAIN 5 TILES OF DISTANCE WHILE THE SCRIPT IS RUNNING AND THEN APPROACH THE TARGET TO GET THE HIT.
